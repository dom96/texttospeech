# Initialise the client:
let client = newTextToSpeechClient()

# Synthesize a some text:
let filename = client.synthesizeToFolder("Hello World!", os.getCurrentDir())
echo("Saved in ", filename) # Open the file in your favourite music player.

# Modifying the options:
echo client.synthesizeToFolder(
  "Nim is the best programming language!",
  os.getCurrentDir(),
  voice=initVoiceSelectionParams(name=some("en-GB-Wavenet-A")),
  audioConfig=initAudioConfig(audioEncoding=OGG_OPUS, pitch = -5)
